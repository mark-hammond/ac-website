[{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Our paper on wave-mean flow interaction on tidally locked planets has been accepted by ApJ – here’s the preprint!\n\nThis work was mostly prompted by two fantastic papers, Showman (2011) and Tsai (2014), which used shallow-water models to understand the global atmospheric circulation of tidally locked exoplanets (one side always faces the star it orbits).\nGCM simulations of these planets look something like:\nThe problem is that this doesn`t look much like the shallow-water model that should correspond to a tidally locked planet (Matsuno (1966)). Here is the response to forcing in zero background flow.\nThe hot spot is in the wrong place compared to the GCM, as are the cold lobes at high latitudes.\nEffect of Equatorial Jet The key thing missing from this solution is the equatorial jet that forms on these planets (Showman (2011)). Tsai (2014) showed that a uniform flow could shift the waves making up this pattern eastwards.\nWe changed this to a non-uniform jet on the equator, and added the fact it is balanced by a pressure perturbation. Here is the respose in a shear background flow.\nThis matches the GCM simulations at the top better. The nice thing about this method was that we were solving one set of equations for one solution, rather than previously where I had summed different solutions together.\nScaling Laws We also solved the problem in a spherical geometry, rather than on the mathematically nice beta-plane approximation. This matches the GCM output more closely, and represents the rotation rate better.\nThis meant we could show the effect of different parameters on the solution. For example, a slow planetary rotation rate looks like:\nand a fast rotation rate looks like:\nThe main difference is caused by the fact that the pressure perturbation from the jet is linearly proportional to the rotation rate. We look at a few more ways the parameters affect the circulation in the paper.\nWe were prompted to understand this circulation better when trying to interpret the phase curve of 55 Cancri e. This sort of model could be useful for observers trying to interpret different phase curves and eclipse maps.\n","date":1540563558,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540563558,"objectID":"d389e5ef1c2770f58b79e25e6a3b0ab3","permalink":"https://github.com/mark-hammond/mark-hammond.github.io/post/wave-mean/","publishdate":"2018-10-26T15:19:18+01:00","relpermalink":"/mark-hammond/mark-hammond.github.io/post/wave-mean/","section":"post","summary":"Our paper on wave-mean flow interaction on tidally locked planets has been accepted by ApJ – here’s the preprint!\n\n","tags":[],"title":"Wave-Mean Flow Interactions in the Atmospheric Circulation of Tidally Locked Planets","type":"post"},{"authors":["**Mark Hammond**","Raymond T.

Simulations, observations, and simple models show that if these planets are sufficiently rapidly rotating, their atmospheres have an eastward equatorial jet and a hot-spot east of the substellar point. We linearize the shallow-water model about this eastward flow and its associated height perturbation. The forced solutions of this system show that the shear flow explains the form of the global circulation, particularly the hot-spot shift and the positions of the cold standing waves on the night-side. We suggest that the eastward hot-spot shift seen in observations and 3D simulations of these atmospheres is caused by the zonal flow Doppler-shifting the stationary wave response eastwards, summed with the height perturbation from the flow itself. This differs from other studies which explained the hot-spot shift as pure advection of heat from air flowing eastward from the substellar point, or as equatorial waves travelling eastwards. We compare our solutions to simulations in our climate model Exo-FMS, and show that the height fields and wind patterns match. We discuss how planetary properties affect the global circulation, and how they change observables such as the hot-spot shift or day-night contrast. We conclude that the wave-mean flow interaction between the stationary planetary waves and the equatorial jet is a vital part of the equilibrium circulation on tidally locked planets.","tags":[],"title":"Wave-Mean Flow Interactions in the Atmospheric Circulation of Tidally Locked Planets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raymond T.

In a nearly circular orbit, such planets have a permanent dayside and a permanent nightside, leading to extreme heating contrasts. In this article, the atmospheric circulations forced by this heating contrast are explored, with a focus on terrestrial planets; here, “terrestrial” refers to planets with a condensed solid or liquid surface at which most of the incident stellar radiation is absorbed and does not imply habitability in the Earthlike sense. The census of exoplanets contains many terrestrial planets that are very likely to be tide locked, including extremely hot close-orbit planets around Sunlike stars and habitable zone (and hotter) planets around lower-mass stars. The circulations are discussed in terms of fluid dynamical concepts arising from study of the Earth’s tropics, supplemented by general circulation model simulations. Even in the relatively simple context of dry (noncondensing) dynamics, there are a number of important unresolved issues that require further study.","tags":[],"title":"Atmospheric Circulation of Tide-Locked Exoplanets","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Our paper on the climate of 55 Cancri e has been accepted by ApJ – here’s the preprint!\nWe found that the observations of Demory (2016) did not rule out an atmosphere, and that our GCM results could be consistent given an atmosphere of several bar, a mean-molecular weight of about 5 g/mol, and cloud formation high on the night-side.\n\nAnother paper on 55 Cancri e also appeared at the same time – “A Case for an Atmosphere on Super-Earth 55 Cancri e”.

The phase curve has a high amplitude and peak offset, suggesting that it has a significant eastward hot-spot shift as well as a large day-night temperature contrast. We use a general circulation model to model potential climates, and investigate the relation between bulk atmospheric composition and the magnitude of these seemingly contradictory features. We confirm theoretical models of tidally locked circulation are consistent with our numerical model of 55 Cnc e, and rule out certain atmospheric compositions based on their thermodynamic properties. Our best-fitting atmosphere has a significant hot-spot shift and day-night contrast, although these are not as large as the observed phase curve. We discuss possible physical processes which could explain the observations, and show that night-side cloud formation from species such as SiO from a day-side magma ocean could potentially increase the phase curve amplitude and explain the observations. We conclude that the observations could be explained by an optically thick atmosphere with a low mean molecular weight, a surface pressure of several bar and a strong eastward circulation, with night-side cloud formation a possible explanation for the difference between our model and the observations.","tags":[],"title":"Linking the Climate and Thermal Phase Curve of 55 Cancri e","type":"publication"}]
