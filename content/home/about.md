## Bio

I am a DPhil student in the Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Planetary Physics Department at the University of Oxford. I work on the atmospheres of exoplanets, with particular interest in the dynamics of their global circulation.


## Research

* Theories of circulation of tidally locked planets
* Numerical simulations of exoplanet atmospheres
* Planets such as 55 Cancri e and the Trappist system

## CV

* DPhil Planetary Physics, in progress (University of Oxford)
* MSci Physics (University of Cambridge)
* BA Natural Sciences (University of Cambridge)
