Our paper on the climate of 55 Cancri e has been accepted by ApJ – here’s the preprint!

We found that the observations of Demory (2016) did not rule out an atmosphere, and that our GCM results could be consistent given an atmosphere of several bar, a mean-molecular weight of about 5 g/mol, and cloud formation high on the night-side.

Another paper on 55 Cancri e also appeared at the same time – “A Case for an Atmosphere on Super-Earth 55 Cancri e”. This is great as we’re (obviously) interested in the possbility of an atmosphere! It looks like we may have reached some similar conclusions by approaching the problem in different ways.
